    <div class="box" style="text-align: left;">
        <h2>What is anime?</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Anime is a style of animation that originates from Japan 
            and has grown into a global phenomenon. It is known for 
            its <b>diverse storytelling, unique art styles and appeal to various age groups.</b>.

            This page aims to explore the popularity and growth of anime 
            from <b>2023 - 2025</b> with the use of multiple visualisations, 
            both <b>globally</b> and in <b>Australia</b>

                    by country in across the selected year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The number of searches is estimated using search index data from <b>Google Trends and estimated

                    We observe that <b>Mongolia</b> has the hiighest

                    To observe the trends in anime popularity over time, we can look at the chart on the right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chart shows the <b>daily anime search index</b> from Google Trends from 2023 to 2024.
                    Data from 2025 was omitted as it is incomplete.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Observe that in both years, there is a gradual increase in anime searches over from Jun to 
                    mid-July, before slowly dropping off again. this is because of the <b>summer anime season</b>, 
                    where many new anime series are released.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, the interest in anime during 2024 seems to be <b>lower</b> than that of 2023 in general,
                    with the exception of a few peaks in interest. This could be due to a variety of factors,
                    such as the <b>quality of anime released, competition from other forms of entertainment, or
                    changes in audience preferences</b>.

                The chart above shows the top 30 anime series and their associated genres. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We can see that some anime series have a large number of genres associated with them, 
                while others have only a few. This suggests that some anime series are <b>more complex and multifaceted</b> than others, 
                which may contribute to their popularity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lolipop chart also shows the top 10 most common genres among the top 30 anime series. 
                We can see that <b>"Comedy"</b> is the most common genre, followed by <b>"Action"</b> and <b>"Fantasy"</b>. 
                These popular genres seem to line up with the top 10 highest rated anime series, 
                which also feature a lot of "Comedy", "Action" and "Fantasy" genres, and are highligheted in the first chart.

                    The scatter plot on the left shows the relationship between an anime's ratings and their popularity.

                <p>
                    Note that the ratings score reflects an individuals viewer's opinion of the anime, from a scale of 1 to 10.
                    The popularity score is a measure of how many people have watched the anime or have it added to their watchlist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chart suggests that whle certain anime gain significant attention and a large following, they <b>may not necessarily be highly rated by viewers</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This could be due to a variety of factors, such as the <b>anime's marketing, hype, or the presence of popular voice actors or directors</b>.
                    Currently <b>trending genres or mainstream appeal</b> could also play a role in an anime's popularity, even if it is not highly rated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data raises interesting questions about the relationship between <b>mass appeal</b> and <b>perceived quality</b> of anime
                    within the community.

                        The charts above show the distribution average age of anime viewers
                        around the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We observe that the average age of anime viewers is between ages 39 to 42,
                        with <b>France</b> having the lowest average age of <b>39</b>, and <b>Japan</b> having the highest average age of <b>41.3</b>.
                        This makes sense as Japan is the birthplace of anime, and has a more established and older fanbase.
                        France has a younger average age, which could be due to the fact that anime is more popular among younger generations in France.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can also notice that there are, in general, <b>more</b> female viewers of anime than male viewers,
                        with the <b>exception of Japan</b>, where there are more male viewers than female viewers.
                        This could be due to <b>cultural</b> differences in the perception of anime and its target audience.
                        In Japan, anime is often seen as a male-dominated medium, while in other countries, it is more widely accepted and enjoyed by both genders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This information suggests that anime appeals to a <b>wide range of age groups</b>,
                        and is not limited to a specific demographic.
