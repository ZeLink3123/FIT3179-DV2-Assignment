    <div class="box" style="text-align: left;">
        <h2>What is anime?</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Anime is a style of animation that originates from Japan 
            and has grown into a global phenomenon. It is known for 
            its <b>diverse storytelling, unique art styles and appeal to various age groups.</b>.

            This page aims to explore the popularity and growth of anime 
            from <b>2023 - 2025</b> with the use of multiple visualisations, 
            both <b>globally</b> and in <b>Australia</b>

                    The map on the left shows the estimated number of <b>anime searches per capita</b> 
                    by country in across the selected year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The number of searches is estimated using search index data from <b>Google Trends and estimated
                    population data from the World Bank</b>.

                <p>    
                    We observe that <b>Mongolia</b> has the hiighest
                    estimated anime searches per capita in 2025.

                    To observe the trends in anime popularity over time, we can look at the chart on the right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chart shows the <b>daily anime search index</b> from Google Trends from 2023 to 2024.
                    Data from 2025 was omitted as it is incomplete.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Observe that in both years, there is a gradual increase in anime searches over from Jun to 
                    mid-July, before slowly dropping off again. this is because of the <b>summer anime season</b>, 
                    where many new anime series are released.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, the interest in anime during 2024 seems to be <b>lower</b> than that of 2023 in general,
                    with the exception of a few peaks in interest. This could be due to a variety of factors,
                    such as the <b>quality of anime released, competition from other forms of entertainment, or
                    changes in audience preferences</b>.

            <p>
                We can see that some anime series have a large number of genres associated with them, 
                while others have only a few. This suggests that some anime series are <b>more complex and multifaceted</b> than others, 
                which may contribute to their popularity.
